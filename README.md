# New Legacy Harvest System

Emulation for Ultima Online's New Legacy Harvest System

Information about the commercial version of this system can be found here: https://www.uo-cah.com/new-legacy/everything-we-know

I am no way associated with Electronic Arts, Broadsword, and any other entity regarding Ultima Online

NOTE: This code is not capable of running on it's own, it's a system written to work as part of the ServUO program

I am publishing this as an initial version, code is still quite messy but I am planning to clean things up and centralize it further into a single method, or two, to populate the gump's pages
